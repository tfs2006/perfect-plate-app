            <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-2 mb-4 leading-tight">The "Trust Stack" Framework</h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">To ensure our reviews are fair, balanced, and genuinely useful, we evaluate every product using our proprietary "Trust Stack" methodology. This framework is designed to look beyond marketing claims and assess products on what truly matters.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">1. Scientific Evidence & Formulation</h2>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Our analysis begins with the product's formula. We scrutinize each ingredient and cross-reference it with high-quality scientific literature from reputable sources like PubMed, the National Institutes of Health, and peer-reviewed journals. We ask critical questions: Is the ingredient included at a clinically effective dose? Does the evidence support the product's claims? We prioritize products with transparent, evidence-backed formulations.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">2. Safety & Quality Verification</h2>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">A great formula is meaningless if the product isn't safe or pure. We investigate whether a product is manufactured in a facility that adheres to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Most importantly, we give strong preference to products that undergo voluntary third-party testing from independent labs (like NSF, USP, or ISO 17025 accredited labs) to verify that what's on the label is actually in the bottle—and nothing else.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">3. Real User Experience</h2>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">To understand how a product performs in the real world, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer reviews from multiple verified-purchase platforms. We look for consistent themes, both positive and negative, regarding a product's effectiveness, taste, side effects, and overall user satisfaction. This helps provide a balanced view beyond the curated testimonials on a product's own website.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900">4. Brand Reputation & Value</h2>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Finally, we assess the company behind the product. Does the brand have a history of transparency and good customer service? Do they offer a fair money-back guarantee? We also evaluate the product's price relative to its formulation and competitors to determine its overall value. We believe a trustworthy product should come from a trustworthy brand.</p>
